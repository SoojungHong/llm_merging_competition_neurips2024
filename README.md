## starter kit 
https://github.com/llm-merging/LLM-Merging

## background of the competition
specialized fine-tuned models can be rapidly merged to combine capabilities and generalize to new skills.

## challenges description
- a list of expert models that have already been trained on a task-specific dataset. 
- All of these models will be publicly available on the Hugging Face Model Hub
- The goal of this competition is to re-use the provided models to create a generalist model that can perform well on a wide variety of skills
- skills are like reasoning, coding, maths, chat, and tool use. 
- a set of validation datasets to measure the time and space efficiency of the merging method. 
- validation datasets are not meant to benchmark the performance of the merging method.
- two sets of hidden tasks that will be used to evaluate the submissions from participants
- hidden test tasks : (1) a set of leaderboard ranking test tasks, and (2) a set of final ranking test tasks.
